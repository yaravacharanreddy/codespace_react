## Optimizing Performance with React Memoization (React.memo)
### Task 1: Create a Memoized Component
1. Create a component named `MemoizedComponent` .
2. Wrap it with React.memo and demonstrate by using it in a parent component to show
performance improvement.

### Task 2: Prevent Re-rendering with React.memo
1. Extend the previous task to demonstrate how React.memo prevents unnecessary re-rendering.
2. Log the rendering of each component to the console to verify.

### Task 3: Custom Comparison Function for React.memo
1. Write a custom comparison function for React.memo to control when re-rendering occurs.
2. Implement it in a component to log re-renders.

**NOTE**: Write your code in `ParentComponent.jsx` component
